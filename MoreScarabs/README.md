# More Scarabs

Mod adds some configs to increase spawning of Scarabs. By default, it will spawn a Jade Scarab in all valid fights.

This was made for the highscoring community, so will likely break the game in casual play on the default settings.

Made at the request of FLOD

Notes:

- This adds a separate roll for the scarabs, so setting it to 10% will first roll the 10% chance for a scarab, if one doesn't spawn, then the default 7% (or 47/57 with Scaraby/corrupted Scaraby) chance will roll.
- To customize, press F5 in game and select the MoreScarabs tab
- I'm not actually sure if this requires Obeliskial Essentials, it shouldn't but better safe than sorry
- Should work for multiplayer. I believe technically only the host needs it installed, but that can lead to all sorts of other issues when the mods aren't identical across all players.
